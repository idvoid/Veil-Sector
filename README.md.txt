**Veil-Sector** is a third-person, anime-stylized, adult-rated shooter RPG set in a post-apocalyptic world overrun by factions of mercenaries, mutated creatures, corrupted science, and breeding-driven insectoids. You play as an elite foreign agent equipped with advanced tech, sent to uncover the truth behind a mysterious mega-island. Combat is fast-paced, sexual themes are intense, and the world reacts to your every decision.
